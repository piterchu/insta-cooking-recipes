# Chicken Katsu Meal Prep

## Informations rapides

⏱️ Préparation : 20 min | 🔥 Cuisson : 20 min | 🍽️ Portions : 2 | 📊 Difficulté : Débutant

## Ingrédients

**Chicken:**
  * 11oz chicken thigh, boneless, skinless, raw
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1/2 tsp black pepper
  * 3/4 cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 1/3 second cooking spray oil

**Batter:**
  * 1 egg
  * 1/4 cup flour
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1/2 tsp black pepper
  * 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  * 1.5 tbsp water

**Sauce:**
  * 4 tbsp cup ketchup
  * 1 tbsp brown sugar
  * 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
  * 2 tbsp oyster sauce
  * 1/2 tbsp garlic powder

  * 1 cup cooked rice
  * 2 cups shredded green cabbage

## Étapes

  1. Chop your cabbage into small pieces.
  2. Season your chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
  3. Pound your chicken thighs to half an inch thick.
  4. In a bowl, crack and whisk your egg, flour, water, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to make a batter-like consistency.
  5. Pour panko breadcrumbs on a plate. Fully dip the chicken thighs into the batter, place it on top of the panko breadcrumbs and mix until fully coated, and put it into the air frier. Repeat this "dipping into the batter and coating with panko breadcrumb process" with every chicken thigh.
  6. Coat the top of the chicken with a quick spray of oil.
  7. Cook for 360°F for 10 min then flip & cook for another 7-10 minutes until the inside is completely cooked through & the crust is crispy brown (cooking times vary with different air-friers).
  8. In a small bowl, mix ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and oyster sauce to make your katsu sauce.
  9. In a meal prep container, add half of your steamed rice, half of your chicken katsu, half of your shredded cabbage, and keep half of your sauce on the side and enjoy!
