# Family Favorite Roasted Chicken

## Informations rapides

- 🌍 Cuisine : Américaine
- 🍽️ Type : Plat principal
- ⏱️ Temps de préparation : 70 minutes (+ 1h marinade)
- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 165 minutes
- 👥 Portions : 6
- 📊 Difficulté : Intermédiaire
- 🥩 Protéine principale : Poulet

### Ingredients

  * 1 whole chicken, butterflied (backbone removed)
  * 1 cup white Pinot wine
  * 1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, softened
  * ½ tablespoon each: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, celery salt
  * 1 teaspoon marjoram
  * 1 teaspoon ground mustard
  * ½ teaspoon turmeric
  * Salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste
  * 1 onion, sliced & 1 whole garlic
  * 1 bunch fresh thyme
  * 1 bunch fresh sage
  * 3 bay leaves

### Steps

  1. Marinate:

Place the butterflied chicken in a large dish. Pour the Pinot wine over it, then rub with softened butter and all the seasonings, including ground mustard. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated. Add the onion slices, thyme, sage, and bay leaves around and beneath the chicken. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for richer flavor).

  2. Roast:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roast the chicken covered for 1½ hours to let the flavors soak in and the meat stay tender.

  3. Uncover & Crisp:

Remove the cover and roast for another 45–60 minutes, until the skin is deeply golden and crisp, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

  4. Rest & Serve:

Let the chicken rest for about 10 minutes before carving. Spoon the buttery pan juices over the top before serving.
