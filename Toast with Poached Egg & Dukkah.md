## Ingredients

**For the spread:**
- ½ ripe avocado
- 2 tbsp Greek yogurt
- ¼ small garlic clove, finely grated
- ½ tsp lemon juice
- Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

**For the toast:**
- 1 thick slice sourdough bread

**Toppings:**

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, mash the avocado with Greek yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper until smooth and creamy.
2. In a small saucepan, bring water to a gentle simmer. Add vinegar. Crack the egg into a ramekin or cup, and gently drop it in the water. Cook for 2½–3 minutes for a runny yolk.

4. In a frying pan over medium heat, heat ½ tsp olive oil. Add spinach and cook for 30 seconds until just wilted. Set aside in a warm place.
5. Once toast is ready, drizzle olive oil and spread the avo-yogurt mixture over the toast, then top with the wilted spinach.
6. Lift out the egg with a slotted spoon, place over paper kitchen towel to drain, then gently place it on top of the spinach.
7. Drizzle olive oil, sprinkle with dukkah and chives. (Add salt and pepper if dukkah is not seasoned) Serve immediately.
