# Short Rib Duchesse

## Informations rapides

- 🌍 Cuisine : Française
- 🍽️ Type : Plat principal
- ⏱️ Temps de préparation : 30 min
- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 120 min
- 👥 Portions : 4
- 📊 Difficulté : Intermédiaire
- 🥩 Protéine principale : Bœuf

## Ingredients

* 1 x 3 bone short rib, cut through bones (4 portions) 
  * 1 carrot, diced 
  * 1 onion, diced 
  * 1 stick celery, diced 
  * 1 head garlic 
  * 1 bunch thyme 
  * 500ml red wine 
  * 750ml brown chicken stock 

Duchess Potatoes 

  * 500g potatoes 
  * 1 egg yolk 
  * 1 whole egg 
  * 25g grated parmesan 
  * 50g melted butter 
  * Maldon salt, to taste

## Steps

1. Bake potatoes until tender, then mash well or pass through a fine sieve. 
  2. In a bowl, quickly mix in the egg yolk, whole egg, and melted butter without scrambling the eggs. Season and reserve in a piping bag. 
  3. Heat a large, heavy-based casserole dish over medium heat. Add vegetable oil and sear the short rib well for 15–20 minutes, gradually, to develop deep color. 
  4. Remove the meat from the pan and add diced vegetables, garlic, and herbs. 
  5. Return the meat to the pan, add red wine, and reduce fully. 
  6. Add the chicken stock, bring to a simmer, cover with a cartouche, and braise in a preheated oven at 160°C for 2–2.5 hours. 
  7. Check doneness: a thin spoon handle should pierce the meat with minimal resistance. 
  8. Remove from the oven, let the meat cool in the liquor, then remove the bones (they should come out easily). 
  9. Press the meat between two heavy trays, bone side up, with weight. When cool, trim into even rectangles. 
  10. Pass the braising liquor through a fine mesh sieve and reduce by 3/4. 
  11. To reheat, bring some reduced sauce and chicken stock to a boil in a sauté pan, remove from heat, and place short rib portions in. 
  12. Pipe the duchesse potato on top of the meat. 
  13. Cook at 220°C (fan-assisted) for 10–14 minutes until the potato is golden and caramelized and the meat is hot and glazed. 
  14. Serve alongside glazed carrots.
