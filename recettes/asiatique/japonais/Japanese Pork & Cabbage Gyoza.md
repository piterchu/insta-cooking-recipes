# Japanese Pork & Cabbage Gyoza

## Informations rapides

- 🌍 Cuisine : Japonaise
- 🍽️ Type : Plat principal
- ⏱️ Temps de préparation : 45 min (inclus 20 min repos chou)
- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 10 min
- 👥 Portions : 4
- 📊 Difficulté : Intermédiaire
- 🥩 Protéine principale : Porc

## Ingredients

- 32 gyoza wrappers
- Vegetable oil, for frying

**Gyoza filling**
- 2 cups cabbage, finely chopped
- 300g pork mince
- 3 - 4 spring onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 thumb piece ginger, grated
- 1 tbsp sake
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp salt

**Dipping sauce**
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- ½ tsp chilli oil, or to taste

## Steps

1. Combine the cabbage and ½ teaspoon of salt in a small bowl and set aside for about 20 minutes to let it wilt slightly. Once softened, squeeze out as much liquid as possible and transfer the cabbage to a large bowl.

2. Add the pork mince, spring onion, ginger, garlic, sake, sesame oil, soy sauce, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix well until the filling is smooth and sticky.

3. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the centre of each gyoza wrapper. Wet the edge with a little water, fold, and pleat to seal tightly. Repeat with the remaining filling, keeping the wrapped gyoza covered with a damp towel so they don't dry out.

4. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add a drizzle of vegetable oil. Arrange the gyoza in the pan and cook until the bottoms are golden. Pour in 1/3 cup water, cover, and steam for about 3 minutes over high heat. Remove the lid and cook until the water evaporates and the bottoms are crisp and golden.

5. Turn off the heat and carefully invert the gyoza onto a plate, arranging them bottom-side up so they stay crispy.

6. To make the dipping sauce, mix the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and Japanese chilli oil in a small bowl and serve alongside the gyoza.
