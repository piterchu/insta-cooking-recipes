# Cantonese Roasted Pork Belly (Airfryer)

## Informations rapides

- 🌍 Cuisine : Chinoise
- 🍽️ Type : Plat principal
- ⏱️ Temps de préparation : 20 min (+ une nuit au frigo)
- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 50 min
- 👥 Portions : 4
- 📊 Difficulté : Intermédiaire
- 🥩 Protéine principale : Porc

## Ingredients

- 1 slab of pork belly, skin-on
- 1 tsp five spice powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp white vinegar
- 1 tsp coarse salt
- Cling film
- Water (for boiling)
- Yellow mustard (optional, for serving)

## Steps

1. In a shallow pan, boil a thin layer of water. Place the pork belly skin-side down and let it sit for 5 minutes - helps soften the skin without cooking the meat.

2. Remove the pork belly from the pan and let it cool slightly. Use a knife (or a bundle of skewers) to poke small holes all over the skin—helps the skin blister and crisp up during roasting.

3. Flip the pork belly over and rub five spice powder and salt into the meat side only. Avoid getting any seasoning on the skin.

4. Use cling film to seal the meat side. Then use paper towel to wipe the skin dry. Brush on a layer of vinegar and cover it with a generous amount of salt. This draws moisture out of the skin to help it crisp up.

5. Place the pork belly skin-side up uncovered in the fridge overnight to air dry.

6. Preheat your air fryer to 365°F (185°C). Cook the pork belly for 30 minutes.

7. Increase the temperature to 395°F (200°C) and cook for another 20 minutes or until the skin is crispy and golden.

8. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with yellow mustard or your favourite dipping sauce.
