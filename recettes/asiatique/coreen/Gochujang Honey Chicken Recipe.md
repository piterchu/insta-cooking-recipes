## Informations rapides

- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 30 minutes
- 👥 Portions : 4
- 📊 Difficulté : Débutant

### Ingredients

  * Chicken thighs
  * 2 tsbp minced garlic
  * 1 tablespoon of ginger
  * 2 tbsp of soy sauce
  * 2 tbsp of gochujang
  * 1/2 salt
  * 1 tbsp sesame oil
  * 1 tbsp rice vinegar
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 1 tbsp brown sugar

### Steps

  1. Mix all the ingredients above and marinate your chicken thighs overnight in a ziploc bag. If you don't have time, that's okay too!
  2. Throw it in your air fryer at 300-350F degrees for 15 mins and flip. Air fry again for 10-15 mins and once you see the slight charred chicken, it means it ready to eat 😋 (if you don't have an air fryer you can just put it on your frying pan & cook that way too, bake it, however you like!)
  3. Put some chopped up scallions on top & sesame seeds and it should be ready
