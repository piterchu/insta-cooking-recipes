# Pork Belly Burnt Ends - Miso Butterscotch Glaze

## Informations rapides

⏱️ Préparation : 20 min | 🔥 Cuisson : 3h30 | 🍽️ Portions : 6 | 📊 Difficulté : Intermédiaire

## Ingrédients

  * 2kg pork belly, skin removed
  * 2 tsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp brown sugar
  * ¼ tsp chilli powder
  * 1 tsp garlic powder
  * 1 tsp smoked paprika
  * 1 tsp cracked black pepper
  * kimchi mac and cheese, to serve

**Miso butter**
  * 125g unsalted butter
  * 110g (½ cup) brown sugar
  * 1 tbsp soy sauce
  * 2 tbsp rice vinegar
  * 3 tbsp white miso
  * 100ml thickened cream

## Étapes

  1. **Prep the pork** - Slice the pork belly into 3cm cubes. Combine the salt, brown sugar, chilli powder, garlic powder, paprika and pepper in a small bowl, mix well. Transfer to a shaker jar if you have one. Shake the seasoning over the pork, turning the pork over to coat evenly on all sides. Place the pork pieces on a wire rack over a tray in a single layer.
  2. **Cook the pork** - Preheat a smoker to 120°C (250°F) (or your oven if you don't have a smoker). Place the tray of pork in the centre of the smoker and cook for 3 hours with the lid closed.
  3. **Make the glaze** - Heat a large, cast iron tray on the stovetop over a medium heat. Add the butter, sugar, soy, vinegar and miso and whisk until melted and well combined. Bring to a simmer. Whisk in the cream, then continue simmering until the glaze starts to thicken slightly.
  4. **Finish and serve** - Remove the pork from the smoker and add to the tray with the glaze. Increase the smoker temperature to 150°C (300°F). Toss the pork gently to combine, then return to the smoker for 30 minutes. Stir pork every 10 minutes to mix through glaze as it begins to get sticky. Remove pork from the smoker and serve coated in sauce with some Wombok slaw and Kimchi mac and cheese on the side. Enjoy!
