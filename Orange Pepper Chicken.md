### Steps

  1. **Marinate**

Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl or large Ziploc bag and fully coat the chicken. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 2–4 hours, or at least 30 mins.

  2. **Cook**

Grill the chicken over medium heat for 12–15 minutes, flipping occasionally. Alternatively, the chicken can be cooked at 400°F in the air fryer for 25 minutes or the oven for about 30 minutes with a flip halfway through. The chicken is done when the internal temperature reaches 170°F.

  3. **Sauce**

When the chicken is finished cooking, preheat a skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Sauté the crushed peppercorns and garlic in olive oil until the garlic just begins to brown and get fragrant, then reduce heat to low. Quickly add in the orange juice and butter so the garlic doesn't burn. Then add the soy sauce, green onion, ginger, and honey. Simmer on low for a few mins until it begins to thicken, then turn off the heat and add the orange zest and salt to taste. Coat the chicken in the sauce then serve.
