# Beef Stock (Ultra-Concentrated)

## Informations rapides

- 🌍 Cuisine : Française
- 🍽️ Type : Fond/Sauce
- ⏱️ Temps de préparation : 30 min
- 🔥 Temps de cuisson : 10 h
- 👥 Portions : 8
- 📊 Difficulté : Avancé
- 🥩 Protéine principale : Bœuf

## Ingredients

- 2.5 kg beef bones
- Neutral oil, for roasting
- 1 tbsp beef tallow
- Carrots, rough-chopped
- Onions, rough-chopped
- Celery, rough-chopped
- 1 whole head garlic, sliced cross-section
- 2–3 tbsp tomato paste
- Thyme
- Bay leaf
- Parsley stems
- 1 tbsp whole black peppercorns
- 2–3 cups red wine (about 1 bottle)
- Water, to cover

## Steps

1. **Roast the bones** – Preheat oven to 450°F (convection on). Lightly oil beef bones and roast 30–45 minutes, until deeply golden brown. Be careful when removing the tray — beef bones render a lot of fat, which can splash and burn.

2. **Build the base** – In a large stockpot over high heat, add 1 tbsp beef tallow. Add carrots, onions, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring well, until lightly caramelized.

3. **Tomato paste & deglaze** – Stir in tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes. Deglaze with red wine and reduce by about half.

4. **Simmer** – Add roasted bones, thyme, bay leaf, parsley stems, and black peppercorns. Cover with water just enough to submerge the bones. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook 8–9 hours, skimming impurities as they rise.

5. **Strain & chill** – Strain the stock and let cool completely. Once cold, remove and discard the hardened fat (next day is ideal).

6. **Reduce** – Return stock to a pot and reduce by ⅓ to ½, until dark, glossy, and gelatin-rich.
